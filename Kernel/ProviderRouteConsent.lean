# Kernel.ProviderRouteConsent -- local consent honours the pinned provider services

A deployment that pins provider services (`providerServices`: resource id and
per-route tariff) has its semantic Host author every law at a service resource
as `ProviderRoute.policy schedule base`, the schedule taken from the pin
(`Host.Json` birth and policy-install authoring). The consent provider reads
the same settings file and checks what custody is about to sign against it: a
draft that births or re-installs the law of a service resource must install
exactly the pinned route law. A draft carrying another schedule, or no route
law, is refused by name before any key signs; this does not trust the
semantic Host that authored the draft.

`check_binds` states what the pin binds: every policy record a consented draft
installs at a service resource is the pinned route law over some base, so
(`ProviderRoute.installed_route_law`) every mutation that law admits satisfies
the pinned schedule's `transition`. `other_schedule_refused` is the refusal pole.
